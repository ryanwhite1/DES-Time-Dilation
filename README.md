 - The `Methods.py` file contains some useful functions that are used throughout other plotting/data operations.
 - The `StretchMethod.py` file is where the widths are calculated and saved (pickled).
 - The `Plot_Generation.py` and `StretchPlot.py` files are where all of the figures have been generated and saved (using the pickled/supplied data). 
 - `FITOPT000.FITRES` and `FITOPT000.LCPLOT` are the files that contain the data used in the project.

 - At the moment, there's no structure to the figures in the repo. Check the paper overleaf for descriptions of each used figure.
